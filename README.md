# 📸 iAttend – Intelligent Face Recognition Attendance System

**iAttend** is a real-time, face recognition–based attendance management system designed for educational institutions. Built using Python, Flask, OpenCV, and `face_recognition`, the system allows contactless, secure, and accurate attendance logging with subject-level and teacher-level data separation.

> 🧠 Powered by computer vision and machine learning  
> 🧾 Transparent attendance tracking  
> 🎓 Developed as a B.Tech Final Year Project (2024-25)

## 📌 Features

- 🎯 **Face Recognition Attendance**  
  Uses webcam and facial embeddings to detect and verify student identity.

- 🔐 **Teacher Authentication**  
  Teachers must log in before starting an attendance session.

- 🧑‍🏫 **Subject-wise Logging**  
  Attendance data includes subject name and teacher identity.

- 📊 **Dynamic Dashboards**  
  Students can view their subject-wise attendance summaries.

- 💾 **CSV-Based Logging**  
  Attendance records are stored in a structured CSV format for portability.

- 🧮 **Performance Tested**  
  > 95%+ accuracy in well-lit conditions with sub-1 minute session times for 30 students.

## 🧰 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kunalsahuu/iAttend.git
   cd iAttend/Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python final.py
   ```

4. **Access in browser**
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

- face_recognition requires dlib, which needs CMake and Visual Studio Build Tools on Windows. If you face errors, you may need to install it via wheel: (further problems should be solved using youtube videos)
  ```
  pip install cmake
  pip install dlib
  pip install opencv-contrib-python
  ```

## 🚧 Limitations & Future Work

### Known Limitations:
- ❌ No liveness detection (vulnerable to spoofing with images)
- 💡 Sensitive to lighting and face orientation
- 🖥️ Local-only storage (no cloud or database integration)
- ❌ Not yet mobile responsive or PWA-enabled

### Future Improvements:
- 🔍 Add blink/movement-based liveness detection
- ☁️ Cloud hosting (Firebase/AWS/GCP)
- 📱 Mobile App Companion (Android/iOS)
- 🧠 Automatic face re-encoding (aging, beard, etc.)
- 🔗 LMS/SIS integration via REST APIs
- 🎓 Admin panel for data cleanup and analytics
